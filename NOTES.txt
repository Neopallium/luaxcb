Memory management:
* xcb_get_setup() returns a block of memory that holds multiple sub-structures.
		This memory can't be freed by Lua and it might be come invalid when the
		xcb_connection is closed.

* Replies from the server are contained in one continuous block of memory that
    holds all sub-structures of the reply.

* Need to add some memory referencing system.

* Memory blocks should be read only.  I don't see a need to allow field to be
		writable.
